# Public export verification

Verified on 2026-11-11 in the standalone public-source directory using Apple silicon, macOS 27.2, Xcode 27.2 and Swift 6.4.2.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `swift test` | Passed: 283 XCTest and 40 Swift Testing tests, zero failures |
| `CC_SIGNING_MODE=adhoc scripts/build-app.sh debug` | Passed; build 20261111.1614, bundle signature verification passed |
| Shell script syntax | All included `.sh` scripts passed `zsh -n` |
| Documentation | Relative Markdown links checked; four language READMEs included |
| Source integrity | Sources and Tests match the previously validated recovery implementation byte-for-byte |

The build emitted existing concurrency/toolchain warnings during tests and a strip-before-resigning warning during packaging; these did not fail the checks. No warnings were suppressed for this publication.

This run did not repeat live website/network acceptance, Wi-Fi-off or reboot/login-item testing, or create a notarized release. Those limitations remain in the review guide. Existing published installers have not changed.

## Publication preparation

- New Git history containing only the curated tree; no private commits or branches imported.
- Excluded internal developer/review records, design history, posters, screenshots, clipboard files, build products and local tooling caches.
- Included required icon resources; source and included assets use Apache-2.0. Branding is documented separately without adding copyright restrictions.
- Replaced hard-coded signing name/team/profile defaults with explicit maintainer configuration.
- Checked tracked text for common token/private-key patterns, local home paths and maintainer signing identifiers; no remaining matches. Reviewed external references and package dependencies. This is a publication hygiene review, not an independent security or intellectual-property audit.

For the exact tree under review, record `git rev-parse HEAD` with any feedback.
